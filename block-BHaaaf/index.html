Its about Aartificial intelligence<br>
    <p>
      Over the coming years and decades, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to become a key component of all modern software. There is a threat here, but there is also an opportunity. Both defensive and offensive cyber operations will be enhanced by artificial intelligence. Furthermore, new methods of cyber-attacks will be developed to exploit the specific weaknesses of AI technology. Furthermore, AI will reshape the way we should think about data protection as it ingests large quantities of training data.

      To ensure that this era-defining technology brings about broadly shared safety and prosperity, it will be essential to have prudent governance at the global level.
