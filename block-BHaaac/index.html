One of the top tourist attractions of Jaipur, the huge Amer Palace Fort sits atop a small hill, and is located at a distance about 11 km from the main city. The magnificent Amer Fort is an extensive palace complex that has been built with pale yellow and pink sandstone, and with white marble. The fort is divided into four main sections that are graced with their own courtyards.


As you arrive at the Amer Fort, you will enter through the Suraj Pol; unless you arrive by car, then you enter via the Chand Pol. Both these gates open into the Jaleb Chowk, which is the main courtyard, where in earlier times, returning armies used to display their plunder to the people. The fort has a number of sections, including the Kingâ€™s quarters, the zenana (where the women lived), gardens, temples, etc.


There are a lot of attractions for one to see at the Amer Fort, including the diwan-e-aam, such mandir, and the Sheesh Mahal. Amer Fort is also home to some underground tunnels that connect Amer to Jaigarh Fort. A part of these tunnels has been restored, and is now open to public as well. Encompassing all this, the Amer Fort is a perfect example of Rajasthani architecture which is a must-visit.


The essence of Amer Fort is encapsulated by the beautiful light and sound show within the fort, where visitors get to see an astounding spectacle about the history of the fort.
