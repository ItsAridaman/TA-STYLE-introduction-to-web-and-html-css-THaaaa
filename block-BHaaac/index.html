Over the coming years and decades, artificial intelligence (AI) is poised to become a key component of all modern software. There is a threat here, but there is also an opportunity. Both defensive and offensive cyber operations will be enhanced by artificial intelligence. Furthermore, new methods of cyber-attacks will be developed to exploit the specific weaknesses of AI technology. Furthermore, AI will reshape the way we should think about data protection as it ingests large quantities of training data.

To ensure that this era-defining technology brings about broadly shared safety and prosperity, it will be essential to have prudent governance at the global level.

AI and Big Data

AI refers to computational tools that can perform certain tasks in place of human intelligence. Technology is advancing at a breakneck speed, much like the exponential growth experienced by database technology in the late twentieth century. As a result, databases have evolved into the core infrastructure for enterprise-level software. In a similar fashion, most of the new value-added in software over the coming decades is expected to come from AI, at least in part.

Over the last decade, databases have evolved significantly in order to deal with the phenomenon of "big data." This refers to the unprecedented size and scope of modern data sets, which are largely gathered from computers that have come to dominate virtually every aspect of modern life. YouTube, for example, receives over 400 hours of video content each minute.

AI and Cyber Security

It is rare to find a news story about a high-profile data breach or a cyber-attack that costs millions of dollars. It is difficult to estimate cyber losses, but the International Monetary Fund estimates they are in the range of US$100-$250 billion annually for the global financial sector (Lagarde 2012). Additionally, with the pervasiveness of computers, mobile devices, servers, and smart devices, the aggregate threat exposure is growing every day. Although the business and policy communities are still struggling to grasp the implications of cyberspaceâ€™s application of AI to cyber security is heralding even greater changes with its newfound importance.
